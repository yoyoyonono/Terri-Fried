## Background
After participating in Ludum Dare 46, I challenged myself to port my entry to as many consoles as I could using various homebrew libraries. The game is a simple platformer where you launch an egg between platforms to avoid falling in lava. The code was written in 72 hours so it isn't perfect, but I decided to provide the source regardless to hopefully help anyone interested in making games for these platforms. Feel free to ask any questions if you need anything to be clarified!


## Compiling
### Windows
#### raylib 
After installing [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases), execute ``make`` in the ``/raylib`` directory.

## Contributing
Feel free to create a fork of this repository if you want to port the game to additional platforms! The code can also be used for any other noncommercial purposes.
